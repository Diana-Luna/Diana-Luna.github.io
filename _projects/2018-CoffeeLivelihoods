Description:
=======================
This project seeks to generate scientific evidence and build capacity for strategic decisions around diversification activities in smallholder coffee farms and cooperatives in Mesoamerica. Using a Participatory Action Research Approach (PAR), we are collectively working and co-creating knowledge on how different diversification strategies may affect food security, climate change resilience, livelihood performance and gender inequity at the household, community and regional scales. In addition, we are examining how this relates to the governance and sustainability of coffee-based agrifood systems.
