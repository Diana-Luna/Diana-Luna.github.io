I am interested in investigating system transformations that can contribute toward achieving both planetary and human health. My [particular focus](https://diana-luna.github.io/research/) is on exploring the extent to which agricultural diversification can improve the food and nutrition security of farming households in rural areas of Central America and East Africa. Currently, I collaborate with three [research groups](https://diana-luna.github.io/projects/) looking for sustainable agricultural practices to ensure livelihood and food security of smallholder farmers.

I have formal [education](https://diana-luna.github.io/cv/) in nutritional science and food systems, complexity and sustainability science, and agroecosystems (i.e. agroforestry and ecosystem services). My interests range from data science and machine learning to participatory action research methods and sustainable livelihoods.  

I believe that access to healthy food is a universal human right, and that science and technology can help to achieve this right in a sustainable way. Yet, I recognize that stakeholders should be involved in the process of scientific inquiry, that *"non-scientific"* knowledge should be recognized and integrated, and that [knowledge should be democratized](https://diana-luna.github.io/portfolio/).
