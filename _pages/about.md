I am interested in investigating pathways for social-ecological systems management, that can contribute toward achieving both **planetary and human health**. My particular focus is on exploring the extent to which agricultural diversification can improve the food and nutrition security of farming households in rural areas of **Central America**. Currently, I collaborate with three research groups looking for approaches and practices that can produce sufficient, healthy food without compromising the capacity of the future generations to produce their food. 

I have formal [education](https://diana-luna.github.io/cv/) in nutritional science and food systems, complexity and sustainability science, and agroecosystems (i.e. agroforestry and ecosystem services). My interests range from data science and machine learning to participatory action research methods and sustainable livelihoods. I believe that access to healthy food is a universal human right, and that science and technology can help to achieve this right in a sustainable way.
