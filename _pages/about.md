I am interested in investigating system transformations that can contribute toward achieving both planetary and human health. My particular focus is on exploring the extent to which agricultural diversification can improve the food and nutrition security of farming households in rural areas of Central America and East Africa. Currently, I collaborate with three [research groups](https://diana-luna.github.io/projects/) looking for sustainable agricultural practices to ensure livelihood and food security of smallholder farmers.
