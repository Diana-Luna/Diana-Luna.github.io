Hungry farmer paradox
======

It is surprising that the people that produce our food are the ones that are more undernourished. When I realized about that issue, I started looking for solutions to improve food and nutrition security of smallholder farmers. My first though was that the solution to this problam was to increase food productivity. It is obvious, isnÂ´t? However, I realized that a lot of initiatives aiming to increase productivity lead to an increase in micronutrient deficiencies and overweight. They could in fact increase *enegy* availability (e.g., Kcal), but they unexpectedly reduced the availability of micronutrients. To increase productivity, farmers where asked to specialize in one or two crops causing an erosion in agrobiodiversity. Instead of farming simultaneously a great diversity of fruit trees, vegetables, cereals, beans, etc., farmers started growing only one type of crop (often maize, rice or wheat). 

Hence, I thought that, if the problem persisted (or worsened) when productivity of a solely crop was increased, we must promote an increase not only in the quantity of food produced but also its quality and diversity. Thus, my research focused on investigating if diversified farming systems supply more diverse foods and nutrients to farmers, and if this production would be translated into a better diet and nutrition of the farmers (and their family), than simplified farming systems. My rationale was that a farmer producing beans, greens, maize and fruits in his/her farm will have a better diet than a farmer producing only maize. However, I realized that the relationship between food production and consumption is more complex that I thought. Farmers often didn't consume what they produce -sometimes they sold their produce and bought unhealthy foods-, food wasn't constantly available throughout the year -making food security fluctuate over the year-, and although farmers' children had a very diverse and nutritious diets their nutritional status was marginal -because the WASH conditions were really poor and infection incidence were very high-. 

Therefore,
